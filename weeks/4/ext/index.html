<h1 id="extension-1-create-an-instrument">Extension 1: Create an Instrument:</h1>

<p>We have seen how <a href="http://www.jimloy.com/physics/harmony.htm">sound can be represented as a summation of sine waves</a>. In this extension, you will process a description of an instrument, which specifies the relative intensities of that instruments <a href="">overtones</a>.  You will modify a copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code> so that the sound emitted for each note has the profile of the specified instrument.</p>

<h2 id="warm-up">Warm Up</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Locate the <code class="highlighter-rouge">instrument</code> package in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">extensions</code> folder.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will find a copy of <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code> in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">instrument</code> package, credited to Sedgewick’s book, as this code is adpated from Sedgewick’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code> and verify that it plays the music files correctly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<ul>
  <li>For the purposes of this work, let’s define a <i>frequency factor</i> as a multiplicative factor to be applied to a frequency <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>:</li>
</ul>

<p>In the example below, let’s assume that <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is 440 Hz (cycles per second), which is concert A. On a piano, this is the A above middle C:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/a440.gif" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>a factor of <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code> results in the same frequency as <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>, because <code class="highlighter-rouge">1*f==f</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>a factor of <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> yields a frequency <strong>an octave higher</strong> than <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For this example, we obtain 880 Hz, which is the A above high C on a piano:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/a880.gif" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>a factor of <code class="highlighter-rouge">4</code> yields a frequency <strong>two octaves higher</strong> than <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we obtain 1760 Hz, an octave above the A above high C:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/a1760.gif" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>a factor of <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> is between one and two octaves higher, and it turns out to be one octave plus  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_fifth">just (or, pure) fifth</a> above the pitch corresponding to <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here we obtain the frequency 1320 Hz, which sounds like the E above high C.</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/e3x.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>The sound is slightly different than on a piano, where the pitches are not perfect but are instead evenly spaced apart from each other.  The corresponding note on the piano has a frequency of 1318.51 Hz, slightly flatter than
what we get by our frequency factor.</p>

<ul>
  <li>a factor of <code class="highlighter-rouge">0.75</code> (ratio of 3:4) yields a note that sounds like an E, but dividing by 4 lowers its
pitch by two octaves.   With <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> at concert A, a frequency factor of 3:4 yields a frequency of 330, whichsounds like the E above middle C:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/e34.gif" alt="" /></p>

<p>Again, the pitch on a piano is slightly different;  in this case it
is slightly flatter at  329.63.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It is thus convenient to specify a frequency factor as the ratio of
two integers.  In the above examples we see 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 3:1, and 3:4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>To build an actual instrument, we must pick the frequency factors we
wish to hear, and specify how strong each should be.  The table below
specifies such an instrument:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The first row is the fundamental frequency.  The second is an octave higher, and is 3/4 as strong as the fundamental frequency.  The third row specifies a
pitch that is a fifth above the fundamental freqnecy, and quieter still at
half the strength of the fundamental frequency.</p>

<p>The waveform that results from such an instrument specification is shown
below in red, with the three frequency factors shown in black:</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/instr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>The <FONT COLOR="red">red solid waveform</FONT> is literally the sum of the</li>
</ul>
<FONT COLOR="black">black dotted waveforms</FONT>
<p>. The 
sound you produce is sampled from the red waveform, and that <strong>is</strong> the
subject of this extension.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The plot shown above is not the subject of this extension, but is shown
to help explain how complex sounds are built from simple ones,
as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The black waveform with the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude">amplitude</a> (the tallest
  black waveform) is the fundamental frequency
  at relative strength 1.  The sample shown is for 1/440 of a second of a
  440 Hz concert-A.  This is sufficient ot show one full cycle of the
  fundamental frequency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The black waveform with the next largest amplitude has relative strength 0.75.  It is
  an octave higher, so it oscillates twice in the timespan of the
  fundamental pitch’s waveform.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The black waveform of smallest amplitude (at half the strength of
  the fundamental frequency) is the 3:2 frequency factor, which sounds
  like a fifth above the fundamental frequency.  As expected, it exhibits 
  1.5 cycles in the timespan of the fundamental pitch’s waveform.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sound of the red waveform, which is what you will produce below, is
similar to an oboe or a clarinet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First prompt the user for how many frequency factors the user wishes
to specify.  In the above example, 3 such frequencies were used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For each frequency factor, prompt the user for its</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Numerator (an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Denominator (an <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code>)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Relative strength (a <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code>)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The information about the frequency factors must be saved (in arrays)
for future use.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The code in <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code>, copied with attribution
 from <code class="highlighter-rouge">PlayThatTune</code>, reads in a file and computes a value
 in a variable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">hz</code> that is the fundamental frequency
 of the tune being played.</p>

    <p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">hz</code> value is computed from concert A (440 Hz), taking the specified
 number of equally spaced chromatic steps above (or below) concert A.</p>

    <p>The relevant details, explained in the lecture slides for this module,
 are not necessary to complete this extension, but please ask if you would
 like clarification.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your task is to modify the assignment to the sample <code class="highlighter-rouge">a[i]</code> in
 the provided code:</p>

    <p><img src="../../../extensions/origformula.png" alt="" /></p>

    <p>The sine wave sampled and assigned there is for:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>the fundamental frequency (<code class="highlighter-rouge">hz</code>, shown in the red box) of the desired pitch</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>relative strength <code class="highlighter-rouge">1.0</code> (the result of the sine function call
 is implicitly multiplied by 1, shown at the red dot).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>In place of that value, you must compute the sum of sine wave samples, one
 for each frequency factor, as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">a[i]</code> is initially zero.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For each frequency factor
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">f&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;</code>, add to <code class="highlighter-rouge">a[i]</code> a sample obtained
 as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>The value passed to the sine function must be multiplied by the 
  frequency factor.  This means multiplying the red-boxed <code class="highlighter-rouge">hz</code> by the ratio of the
  numerator and denominator of the frequency factor.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The value returned from the sine function must be multiplied by the
  relative strength of the frequency factor.  This happens at the red dot.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Test your program on the <code class="highlighter-rouge">A.txt</code> file first, which is a
single note.  Then try <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ascale.txt</code> and some other songs.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="extension-2-draw-a-sound-wave">Extension 2: Draw a Sound Wave:</h1>

<h2 id="warm-up-1">Warm Up</h2>
<p>To understand this extension, you should first be familiar with the 
extension in which an instrument’s sound is produced as the sum of
sine waves.</p>

<p>You will modify your program further in this extension to produce the sine-wave
plots that depict how sine-wave addition occurs.</p>

<p>The details of this assignment are not completely specified so that
you must think through what is needed to produce meaningful plots.
Ask for help as needed!</p>

<h2 id="procedure-1">Procedure</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An example of a plot is shown below:</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/instr.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The black waveform with the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amplitude">amplitude</a> (the tallest
black waveform) is the fundamental frequency
at relative strength 1.  The waves shown are for 1/440 of a second of a
440 Hz concert-A.  This is sufficient ot show one full cycle of that
fundamental frequency.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The black waveform with the next largest amplitude has relative strength 0.75.  It is
an octave higher, so it oscillates twice in the timespan of the
fundamental pitch’s waveform, at 880 Hz.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The black waveform of smallest amplitude (at half the strength of
the fundamental frequency) is 660 Hz: the 3:2 frequency factor, which sounds
like a fifth above the fundamental frequency.  As expected, it exhibits 
1.5 cycles in the timespan of the fundamental pitch’s waveform.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The red waveform is the sum of the black ones.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each of the frequency factors incorporated into an instrument
is shown separately by plotting dots of the curve as the values
are computed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>With frequencies on the order of hundereds or thousands of
cycles per second, we must limit the time of the plot so that we
can see one or two cycles clearly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Think about how many <strong>samples</strong> you need to capture to show
one complete cycle at 440 Hz.</p>

<p>One way to reason about this is to use
the units of the various computations and multiply or divide them to obtain
the property you seek.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Plot the individual waveforms using black dots, as shown above.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plot the summation waveform using red connected line segments, as shown
above.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball">Magic Eight Ball</a>
is an autoresolution device. A question of <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean</code> type is
posed, the Magic Eight Ball is turned over, and it then displays its advice
in a murky window.  It has resurfaced in other guises over the ages, most
recently perhaps as <a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Magic_Conch_Shell"> The Magic Conch Shell</a> in the
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com/wiki/Club_SpongeBob">Club SpongeBob</a>
episode of 
<a href="http://spongebob.wikia.com"> SpongeBob SquarePants</a>.</p>

<p>To receive credit for this extension, your implementation of the
Magic 8 Ball must:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Repeatedly prompt the user for his or her question using <code class="highlighter-rouge">ArgsProcessor</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dramatically cause the answer to emerge in a (<code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code>)
display, over a 2-5 second period, as follows:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Display the result in a triangular shape, such as shown
  <a href="http://www.indra.com/cgi-bin/spikes-8-ball"> here</a>. (Your solution
  will be much more dramatic as you include the following.)  Your triangle
  need not rotate.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your rendering must fade the image from black to showing the
  triangle with text in a continuous manner, as the answer emerges.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Your rendering of the answer must cause the text go from blurry to
  sharp as the answer emerges.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Try to have a suitably eerie sound accompany your display. (not necessary

<p>Although the solution can be quite short (mine weighed in at approximately
50 lines), there are some tricky aspects to this work, and it may be an
extension that you work on over several weeks.</p>

<p>You will have to interact with the mouse, perhaps for the first time, both
in terms of its location and determining whether the mouse has been pressed and
released.  It will take patience to get this to work, but most students like
the end result.</p>

<h2 id="the-idea">The idea</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Each time the mouse is clicked, an eyeball is deposited on the image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Each eyeball consists of two parts:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>An outer filled circle that is white with a thin black border.  This part
      of the eyeball does not move as the mouse moves around the screen.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>An inner filled circle with of some color (mine are red, below). This part of the eyeball does move, so that the eyeball can appear to be looking at something.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All eyeballs seem to look at the mouse, wherever the mouse moves within the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> window.</p>

<h2 id="part-0-initialize-your-application">Part 0: Initialize your application</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Begin by drawing the picture in the image.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt the user to specify the maximum number of eyeballs that will be drawn.  This information is necessary so that you can appropriately provision arrays needed to implement this extension.</p>

    <p>This code is included in your repository.  Open the

  package. Open and run the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Eyeballs</code> class.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="part-1--detecting-mouse-clicks">Part 1:  Detecting mouse clicks</h2>
<p>Most programs that interact with the mouse use a <em>listener</em> model that
takes action when the mouse is moved, pressed, released, or clicked (a press
and release action).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, in Sedgewick’s API, we can only determine the current
status of a mouse button as up or down.  We must then use logic and
iteration to discover whether a mouse has been pressed, released, or 
clicked.</p>

<p>This low-level API for the mouse leads to
some mixed feelings about how you are learning to interact with the mouse:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The code you write will not be typical of how most Java programs
  interact with the mouse.  The reason for this is that your work takes
  place in an infinite loop, slowed only by the use of <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.pause(n)</code>,
  which consumes resources on your computer even when you are not moving
  the mouse.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are essentially <em>polling</em> the mouse as to whether it
  is up or down, and then using your own logic to determine whether
  it has been pressed, released, clicked, or dragged.<br />
  From a pedagogical perspective, you
  will learn how this kind of processing takes place at a low level on some
  computers.  You also learn how to track the <em>state</em> of an input device
  over time, and many applications require this kind of logic.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Following is a description of mouse actions as they are typically 
used in most applications:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Mouse press</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>We think of this as a single push-down action on a mouse or trackpad. This action usually initiates some activity in applications.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>From an application’s point of view,
this event
happens just once when the mouse is pushed down.  Generation of another mouse
press action would require the mouse to be released, and then pressed again.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Mouse release</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>If a mouse has been pressed, then it can be released.  Some applications distinguish between the press and release, so that the mouse can move between those actions.  This is sometimes called <i>dragging</i> the mouse.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt>Mouse click</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>While this is a compound action, consisting of a mouse press followed by a mouse release, it is usually treated as an atomic action that takes place at exactly one coordinate.  The release also happens within some reasonable timeframe of the press, if the press and release are to be construed as a click.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>The above mouse actions are the logical ones that we wish
to implement.  Actually, it suffices for this extension to
determine only a mouse release, but you are welcome to think about how to
discover the other actions.</p>

<p>The Sedgwick API offers only the following interface, which
we must use in our application to simulate the above mouse actions.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">double mouseX()</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>returns the x-coordinate of the mouse, expressed in terms of the coordinates of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">double mouseY()</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>returns the y-coordinate of the mouse, expressed in terms of the coordinates of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw</code> canvas.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean mousePressed()</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A better name for this would be <code class="highlighter-rouge">boolean isMouseDown()</code>, because
this method does not detect a mouse press in the standard view of mouse
actions.  Instead it simply reports whether the mouse button is currently 
pressed or not.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Your task is to simulate a mouse-click action using the above API.<br />
This will inevitably involve <em>polling</em> the mouse as to whether the
button is down or up.  Consider the following code:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>while (!StdDraw.mousePressed()) {
	// do nothing, 
	// we are waiting for the mouse button to go down  
	//
	// The line below is important, as described below
	//
	StdDraw.show(50);
}
</code></pre>
</div>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Without the pause using <code class="highlighter-rouge">StdDraw.show(50)</code>, this application 
  would run in a <em>tight</em> loop
  that would always keep your computer busy, even if you are not interacting
  with the application.   As a result, all of the other applications open on your
  computer would suffer from not getting sufficient CPU resources to be
  reponsive.  These applications would appear to behave sluggishly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sedgewick uses the pause intervals to hide updates that you make to
  the drawing canvas.   Between calls to show, no updates are shown.
  At the call to show, the screen is redrawn, and the CPU is released
  for the specified period of time (50 milliseconds in the above code).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure your eyeballs are depositing properly as you mouse-click before
you move on to implement more features.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-following-the-mouse-movement">Part 2: Following the mouse movement</h2>

<p>A pupil within an eyeball tracks objects using the geometry of similar
triangles.  The following diagram and discussion may be useful.</p>

<p><img src="../../../extensions/eyeball.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The eyeball is centered at <code class="highlighter-rouge">(ex,ey)</code> and is looking at the
  object (the mouse) at <code class="highlighter-rouge">(mx,my)</code>.<br />
  This leads to the following equations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">mx = ex + dx</code></li>
      <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">my = ey + dy</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing <code class="highlighter-rouge">(ex,ey)</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">(mx,my)</code>, we can solve
  for ` dx<code class="highlighter-rouge"> and </code>dy`.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing <code class="highlighter-rouge">dx</code> and ` dy<code class="highlighter-rouge">, we can 
  compute </code>d` using the distance formula.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We know <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code>, because it is the radius of the eyeball minus
  the radius of the pupil.  This may be hard to see, but convince yourself
  of this by looking carefully at the figure.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The green triangle is similar to the large triangle.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing ` p `  and <code class="highlighter-rouge">d</code>, we can compute their ratio.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>That same ratio describes</p>

    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">px</code>:<code class="highlighter-rouge">dx</code>
  <code class="highlighter-rouge">py</code>:<code class="highlighter-rouge">dy</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>From those ratios we can compute ` px<code class="highlighter-rouge"> and </code> py`.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Knowing <code class="highlighter-rouge">(ex,ey)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">px</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">py</code>, we can
  compute the center of the red pupil as <code class="highlighter-rouge">(ex+px,ey+py)</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</h2>

<p>Your code is like the bouncing ball code, in that it enacts a sequence
of frames.  Each frame consists of checking whether and where a new eyeball
should be deposited.  Moreover, all existing eyeballs must be updated so
that they appear to be tracking the mouse as it moves through the window.</p>

<p>Give yourself time for this extension, and develop and test the aspects
in the order described above.</p>

<p>We suggest that you wait until you have completed module 5 to do this extension, as the information in module 5 will help.</p>

<p>Your task is simple: slow down the way that the eyes move from the previous extension. They should still follow the mouse, but it should take some time for the eyes to arrive at their final position.</p>

<p>You are not allowed to do this by slowing the simulation down. Instead, you
must smoothly vary where the eyes should look in the normal speed of the
simulation.</p>

<h2 id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>The purpose of this assignment is to give you the skills to index and analyze <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>s in order to prepare for 
different web scraping tasks. Once you are able to extract information of interest from a target <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>, you 
will be ready to query a webpage, save the raw HTML code, and extract relevant information.</p>

<p>For this assignment, you are working on simple arithmetic expressions as <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>s. Your task is to extract the 
two integer values and the arithmetic operator from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> and save them as variables of their respective 
type. You will then compute and print the value of the expression.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Given: <code class="highlighter-rouge">String s = "21 + 33";</code></p>

<p>You must extract <code class="highlighter-rouge">21</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">33</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> variables and <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">char</code> or 
<code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> variable. Then you will compute and print the expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">21 + 33 = 54</code></p>

<h2 id="procedure-2">Procedure</h2>

<p>As previously mentioned, the purpose of this assignment is to prepare you for dynamic web scraping tasks. As 
such, it is expected that you implement this assignment dynamically. In other words, the only assumption you should have 
about the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> you are analyzing is that it will be in the format <code class="highlighter-rouge">(Positive Integer)(Arithmetic Operator)
(Positive Integer)</code>. This implies your implementation should be able to run effectively on an expression containing 
positive integers of any length. It should also be able to effectively extract any arithmetic operator (+, -, *, /) and 
print the proper answer. Lastly, your code should be able to deal with possible spaces in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code>.</p>

<p>It is important to note that there are many acceptable ways to implement this assignment. It is up to your discretion which 
way you choose to implement the procedure as long as it abides by the requirements described above.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Listed below are several helpful methods for this assignment. The first is from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> class and is called 
on the target <code class="highlighter-rouge">String t</code>. The other four are static methods. Recall that static methods are not called on a target 
variable as in the previous method, but rather are called on a generic object of that type.</li>
</ul>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#charAt(int)">char charAt(int i)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the character at index <code class="highlighter-rouge">i</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#isDigit(char)">boolean Character.isDigit(char c)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns true if <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> is a digit and false otherwise.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#isWhitespace(char)">boolean Character.isWhitespace(char c)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns true if <code class="highlighter-rouge">c</code> is white space.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#toString(char)">String Character.toString(char c)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> representation of a character.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Integer.html#parseInt(java.lang.String)">int Integer.parseInt(String s)</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Returns the <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> representation of a String.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Begin by extracting the first integer value from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> using the methods described above. Keep in mind 
 that the integer can be multiple digits. You might be extracting 2 or 274539.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement a similar approach for the operator and second integer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now that you have the two integers in <code class="highlighter-rouge">int</code> variables and the operator in a <code class="highlighter-rouge">char</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">String</code> 
 variable, perform and print the simple arithmetic operation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
