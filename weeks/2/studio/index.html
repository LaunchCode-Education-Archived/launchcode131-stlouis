<p>Feel free to participate in a different group than last time. This is totally
up to you, but try to find a group that makes it easy for you to participate.</p>

<p>Be careful how you use the web.  You are required to develop solutions
as a group by thinking not by finding solutions that have been thought
out by others.  You must be able to explain anything that you have done.</p>

<h1 id="warmups">Warmup(s)</h1>

<ul>
  <li>First, form a group:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are at a table with a large, wall-mounted screens, a group of 3-4 people is fine.</li>
      <li>If you are seated at a table without a large screen, a group of 2 people is better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along
and see the instructions as you work.</li>
  <li>Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work.
Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.</li>
  <li>Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard.  Before
doing so, <strong>commit your work</strong> to make sure your work is saved.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="problem-1-gamblers-ruin">Problem 1: Gambler’s Ruin</h1>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will simulate the Gambler’s Ruin problem. The problem is as follows: you are a gambler 
given some initial amount of money, and each time you gamble, you either win or lose $1 based on your win probability. 
You have some goal in mind, that once reached, you stop gambling, or if you lose all of your money, you also 
stop gambling. What is the probability that you lose all of your money?</p>

<h2 id="procedure">Procedure</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>With your repository open, create a new class in the <kbd>studio2</kbd> package.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Be sure to check the box that generates <kbd>public static void main</kbd>. Otherwise you will have to type that by hand.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Have your program accept the following inputs:</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>If you don’t remember how to do this, look at code from a previous studio or lab.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <dl>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">startAmount</code></dt>
      <dd>The amount of money that you start with</dd>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">winChance</code></dt>
      <dd>The probability that you win a gamble</dd>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">winAmount</code></dt>
      <dd>If you reach this amount of money, then you won</dd>
      <dt><code class="highlighter-rouge">totalPlays</code></dt>
      <dd>The number of times you simulate the problem</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Next, calculate the chance that you ruin.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>if (lossChance != winChance)<br />
Ruin = ((lossChance/winChance)<sup>startAmount</sup> - (lossChance/winChance)<sup>winAmount</sup>) / (1 - (lossChance/winChance)<sup>winAmount</sup>)
<br /><br />
if (lossChance == winChance)<br />
Ruin = 1 - startAmount / winAmount</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Simulate the Gambler’s Ruin <strong>totalPlays</strong> times. For each simulation, continue gambling until you 
either reach your goal or you ruin. For each simulation, print the simulation number, the number of rounds that 
simulation played for, and whether you won or lost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, print the total number of losses, simulations, your actual ruin rate, and your 
expected ruin rate.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Given this input:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">startAmount</code></td>
      <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">winChance</code></td>
      <td>0.25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">winAmount</code></td>
      <td>15</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">totalPlays</code></td>
      <td>31</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Your final output should look similar to this:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	Simulation 1: 22 rounds  	LOSE

<h1 id="problem-2-computing-pi-by-throwing-darts">Problem 2: Computing Pi by throwing darts</h1>

<p>Computer scientists often use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation" title="simulation">simulation</a> as a means of
modeling, understanding, and predicting real-world phenomena.</p>

<p>Your group is auditioning for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivor_%28TV_series%29">survivor</a>
by proving your group’s ability to compute <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> using
only the materials at hand, as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A unit-square dart board (say, 1 meter by 1 meter).  Unit-square
 dart boards are astoundingly resilient in plane crashes,
 and yours is nicely intact.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some darts, suitable for throwing at the dart board.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A string and a stylus, standard safety-kit issue, suitable for
inscribing a unit circle in your unit-square dartboard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A dart-throwing expert.  However, since the plane crash, the
expert is left with the (uncanny) ability to throw darts that always land
somewhere, uniformly and randomly, within the unit-square dart board.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>While the thrower never misses the unit square, the darts
land sometimes within the inscribed circle, sometimes not.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>As a group, develop an approach for computing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi">Pi</a> based on
the above materials.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement your approach using iteration. You can start with the following
<a href="../../../studios/Pi.java">Pi.java</a> file that you can paste into a new
Java class in one of your lab projects.</p>

    <p>You will need to simulate a random dart thrower. The function <code class="highlighter-rouge">math.random()</code> will help, as it returns a nonnegative
 double less than 1.0.  You may also find the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Math.sqrt()</code> function to be helpful.</p>

    <p>This may be the first new Class you have developed, but eclipse makes it easy:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Right-click on the package name in which you want to define the new class.  In this case, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">studio2</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">New...</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Choose <code class="highlighter-rouge">Class</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Pick the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pi</code> for this class, since the code you will paste is for class <code class="highlighter-rouge">Pi</code>. <strong>Java style dictates that its classes should begin with a capital letter!</strong></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>When the editor opens for your new class, copy and paste the code from
 <a href="../../../studios/Pi.java">Pi.java</a> into the class.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Investigate and discuss how well your
technique computes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" title="Pi Wiki">Pi</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="further-investigations">Further investigations</h1>

<p>If you have time, pick one or both of the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Investigate the fairness of the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html#random()" title="Math.random() docs"><code class="highlighter-rouge">math.random()</code></a> method.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>What normative criteria should a random number possess?</li>
      <li>How can you measure the fairness of a random number generator?</li>
      <li>Implement some tests and discuss your results amongst yourselves and
 other groups.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There are other ways of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi" title="Pi Wiki">computing Pi</a>.
Try some of these and study their effectiveness in terms of the number of iterations you use.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
