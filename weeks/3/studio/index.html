<h1 id="warmups">Warmup(s)</h1>

<ul>
  <li>First, form a group:
    <ul>
      <li>If you are at a table with a large, wall-mounted screens, a group of 3-4 people is fine.</li>
      <li>If you are seated at a table without a large screen, a group of 2 people is better.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All but one member of your group should have this web page open so you can follow along and see the instructions as you work.</li>
  <li>Plan to have one computer at which your team does its work. Initially, one of you will be in charge of typing at that computer.</li>
  <li>Throughout the studio, you should trade who is in charge of the keyboard. Before doing so, <strong>commit your work</strong> to make sure your work is saved.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this studio you will make a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">sieve of Eratosthenes</a>
on a one dimensional array. This simple, ancient algorithm finds all the prime numbers within a specified range by 
eliminating all multiples in the array. 
##Procedure</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create an array of length <strong>n</strong> and iteratively fill the array with consecutive integers starting with 2.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The size of the array is the only input we need from the user.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Normally we would start filling an array at the beginning (the zeroth element), but since we are filling it with
 consecutive ascending integers, we can simplify our code by ignoring the 0 and 1 indexes, and making the 2 index 
 in the array equal to 2, 3 equal to 3, and so on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Start at the first number in the array (2) and iteratively find and delete all of its multiples (4, 6, 8, etc.)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>How should we “delete” these values?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you reach the end of the array, go to the next <em>undeleted</em> element in the array and repeat this process.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>This way, the first element we touch is always prime. Do you see why? Why should we not bother finding multiples 
of previously deleted numbers?</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you have gone through the whole array, anything remaining is a prime number. Print out these numbers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Ex: for n = 50 the expected output is</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">
Primes under 50 = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
